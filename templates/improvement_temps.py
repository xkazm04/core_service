3. Emotional Expression and Mood:
- Characterize typical emotional state (cheerful, melancholic, calm, anxious).
- Indicate emotional stability or variability.

4. Sense of Humor:
- Categorize humor type (sarcastic, witty, playful, dark, absent).
- Identify humor purpose (coping, social bonding, distancing).

5. Behavioral Tendencies:

- Highlight confidence, insecurity, empathy, or detachment signs.

6. Background and Motivations (Optional but Valuable):
