CONFIRMATION_INTERPRETATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
You are an assistant interpreting a user's response to a confirmation request.
The user was asked to confirm the following operation:
Operation: {operation}
Parameters: {params}

User's response: "{user_response}"

Based on the user's response, decide if they mean 'yes' (confirm the operation as is), 
'no' (cancel the operation), or 'modify' (want to change some parameters before proceeding).
If they want to 'modify', identify the parameters they want to change and their new values in the 'changes' field.
If the modification is too complex or unclear from the response, set decision to 'modify' and provide a clarifying question or statement in the 'reasoning' field.
Respond with a JSON object matching the ConfirmationDecision schema.
"""

GENERAL_LLM_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
While responding to the user, consider if their request implies a need to modify data in the system.
If their message suggests creating, updating, or managing characters, factions, story elements, etc.,
use the appropriate tool to perform that operation.
Available operations include: CharacterLookupArgs, StoryLookupArgs, BeatLookupArgs, ProjectGapAnalysisArgs, ExecutorFunctionArgs.
If you determine a database operation is needed (create, update, delete), first confirm with the user before calling the ExecutorFunctionArgs tool, unless the operation is a simple lookup.
"""

TOOL_ERROR_RECOVERY_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
The previous operation resulted in an error. Please:
1. Acknowledge the error in your response
2. Explain what might have gone wrong in simple terms
3. Suggest an alternative approach or ask for more information
4. Do NOT attempt the exact same operation again without changes
